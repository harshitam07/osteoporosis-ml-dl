Detection of Osteoporosis in Knees Using X-Ray Images and Lifestyle Analysis
The project focuses on the detection of osteoporosis in knees by leveraging a dual approach: analyzing X-ray images and assessing lifestyle factors, with a specific emphasis on gender-based differences. Utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy of osteoporosis detection by integrating radiographic data with lifestyle indicators such as diet, physical activity, and medical history. By tailoring the analysis separately for male and female subjects, the approach recognizes the distinct physiological and lifestyle-related factors influencing bone health in different genders. This comprehensive method not only improves early detection but also supports personalized treatment plans, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes in osteoporosis management.
